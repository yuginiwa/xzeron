Meta data
Ensure unique, descriptive <title> (~50–60 chars) and <meta name="description"> (~150–160 chars) on every page to improve relevance and click-through.

Include <meta name="robots" content="index,follow"> on public pages and avoid accidental noindex on production builds.

Use Next.js App Router metadata APIs or head to centralize titles, descriptions, and alternates for consistency.

Open Graph
Add Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, og:type) and Twitter Card (summary_large_image) for rich shares and brand control.

Validate OG images and tags with Vercel’s Open Graph inspector to ensure correct rendering across networks.

Consider dynamic OG generation (e.g., /api/og) for programmatic images that include page-specific content.

Robots and sitemap
Serve a robots.txt at the root to declare crawl rules and point to the sitemap for better discovery.

Provide a sitemap.xml that lists canonical URLs and updates automatically via Next.js sitemap.(js|ts) convention. 

If robots.txt changes don’t reflect immediately, account for CDN caching behavior and purge when needed.

Canonicalization
Add a page-level <link rel="canonical"> to the preferred URL to prevent duplication and consolidate signals.

If a custom domain is (or will be) used in addition to the vercel.app hostname, enforce one public-facing host and set canonicals to that host.

Avoid indexing preview deployments and secondary domains to prevent duplicate-content issues.

Structured data
Add JSON-LD for Organization, Website, BreadcrumbList, Article/BlogPosting, Product, etc., to qualify for rich results and better SERP context.

Keep schema consistent with on-page content and validate with Rich Results Test before deployment.

Generate schema from page data during build/server rendering to keep it fresh and complete.

Core Web Vitals
Optimize LCP by prioritizing hero image, using next/image with appropriate sizing, and preloading critical assets.

Reduce CLS by reserving space for media/fonts and loading fonts with minimal layout shift strategies.

Improve responsiveness (INP) via code-splitting, reducing JS, and deferring non-critical work to keep interactions snappy.

Content architecture
Use a single, descriptive H1 per page with logical H2/H3 hierarchy to clarify topical structure.

Ensure internal links use descriptive anchors and connect related pages to help crawlers and users navigate.

Create indexable content hubs (e.g., services, features, blog) with clear taxonomies and pagination where applicable.

Social image
Provide a high-resolution default OG image and per-page overrides for key landing pages and articles.

Prefer 1200×630 (or similar) with good contrast, clear branding, and key value props.

Programmatically set social images in metadata to match the page title/summary for better share performance.

Redirects
Set 301 redirects to consolidate http→https and any non-preferred host to the canonical host.

Remove or noindex test/preview paths to avoid duplicate indexation or thin content exposure.

Keep a custom 404 page that returns 404 status and provides helpful navigation to reduce pogo-sticking.

Analytics
Enable lightweight analytics to monitor traffic, crawl, and content performance while preserving Core Web Vitals.

Track conversions and key events to inform content and UX improvements tied to business outcomes.

Use insights to prioritize content updates and technical fixes that improve engagement and rankings.

Next.js essentials
Put robots.txt in public/ or generate via app/robots.ts to keep crawl rules version-controlled and explicit.

Generate sitemap via app/sitemap.(js|ts) for all important routes with accurate lastModified and priorities. 

Centralize site metadata and alternates in layout metadata to avoid drift across pages and deployments.

Vercel specifics
Prevent duplicate content between the vercel.app subdomain and a custom domain by enforcing one indexable host and setting proper canonicals.

Keep preview deployments noindex, and ensure production is indexable with correct headers and meta robots.

Use Vercel OG inspector and platform guidance to validate metadata and social previews before going live.

Actionable snippets
Robots: Use a static public/robots.txt or app/robots.ts to declare crawl rules and link to sitemap.

Sitemap: Implement app/sitemap.(js|ts) to emit a current sitemap during build with correct URLs. 

Metadata: Configure titles/descriptions/OG in a single place via Next.js App Router’s metadata patterns for consistency across pages.

What to verify now
Presence and correctness of title/description, OG/Twitter, and canonical tags on the homepage and key pages.

robots.txt is reachable, sensible, and references sitemap.xml; sitemap.xml lists all important URLs with correct canonical host.

Core Web Vitals budgets in place and measured after deployment, with images/fonts optimized via Next.js features.
